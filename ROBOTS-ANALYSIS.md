## Explanation

## Explanation

- **User-agent: \***  
  This directive applies to all web crawlers. The file specifies a `Crawl-delay` of 10 seconds, meaning that any automated scraper or crawler should wait 10 seconds between requests to avoid overwhelming the website's server. The `Allow: /` directive means that all pages on the site are permitted to be scraped, as long as the crawler respects the specified crawl delay.

- **User-agent: SemrushBot**  
  This section specifies that the SemrushBot crawler is disallowed from accessing any part of the website (`Disallow: /`). This is likely to prevent the specific crawler from overloading the site with requests or for competitive reasons.
